Vacation Planner is a social media web application for planning, inviting, and communicating about a user's upcoming vacations. Users have the ability to create vacation components in their dashboards, add activites, comments, and invite other users to said vacation. This project was a collaborative effort between of a team of 6 cross-functional developers, completed in 1 week. The application was created using React, Redux, React Router, React-Redux, and vanilla CSS. I (Adam Monast) was responsible for designing/implementing the main app functionality on the frontend.

Future plans for this project include: Fixing the bugs with adding comments, implementing my own backend API to power the app (I do not have access to the current one), and cleaning up the code for better maintainability and keeping it DRY. Thank you for viewing this project and all feedback is appreciated!
